# Learning eBPF – Practice Repo

This repository contains my notes and code as I work through the examples in the book **[Learning eBPF](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-ebpf/9781098135101/)** by Liz Rice (published by O'Reilly).

I’m using this repo to better understand how eBPF works, and to experiment with the practical examples provided in the book. The chapters are structured similarly to the original examples and include my own modifications, tests, and learnings.

##  Credits

All example code and exercises are based on:

- The book: [Learning eBPF](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-ebpf/9781098135101/)
- The companion GitHub repository: [lizrice/learning-ebpf](https://github.com/lizrice/learning-ebpf)

Look at Liz Rice’s excellent book and repo for the official source code and explanations.

## Environment

I'm using [Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima) to run an Ubuntu VM with the required kernel and tools. You can find the Lima config I based mine on in the original repo as `learning-ebpf.yaml`.
